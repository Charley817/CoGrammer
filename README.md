#Backend
For the backend of the application I made an express server which would have been used as the API to communicate with the database and the frontend. 

#Frontend 
For the frontend I made the outlay of a react application. I did not finish this part due to time constraints. 

#Database 
I have a Postgres database with a queries.txt file that is a list and explanation of the queries I wanted to use in my API. 

##Integration
I have knowledge of React, Express and Postgres. I struggled with integrating the 3 components and therefore only submitted what I have which is the 3 components seperately. 

##About the website 
My goal for the website was to make a checklist for different occasions. For instance in the example I submitted, the checklist was for a diaper bag for a newborn baby. 
I wanted to extent this to a vehicle checklist, a checklist for holidays and a checklist for when you move (per room).
